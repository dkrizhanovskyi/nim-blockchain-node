# Nim Blockchain Node

## 🚀 Introduction
The Nim Blockchain Node is a modular, high-performance blockchain node implementation written in the Nim programming language, designed for security, scalability, and maintainability. It provides a clear separation of concerns through distinct layers and leverages advanced cryptographic techniques.

## 🧱 Key Components
- **Core Engine Layer:** Handles consensus mechanisms, virtual machine execution, and state management.
- **Cryptography Layer:** Provides key management, signature verification, and zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Network Layer:** Manages peer-to-peer communication, mempool handling, and block propagation.
- **Storage Layer:** Offers efficient and reliable blockchain, index, and state data storage.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dkrizhanovskyi/nim-blockchain-node.git 
cd nim-blockchain-node
nimble install
nimble build
.\main.exe
```

## 🧪 Testing
Run tests to ensure reliability:
```shell
nimble test
```
