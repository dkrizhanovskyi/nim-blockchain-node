# Type: Validator
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Defines the structure of a network validator.
#
# Fields:
# - id: Unique identifier of the validator, critical for ensuring accountability.
# - stake: The amount staked by the validator, directly influencing their voting power.
# - Larger stakes imply higher responsibility and influence within the consensus.
# - Stake management ensures economic incentives align with network integrity.
# - isActive explicitly controls validator participation, allowing quick removal or suspension during malicious activities.
# ------------------------------------------------------
type
  Validator* = object
    id*: string       # Unique identifier of the validator
    stake*: int       # Amount of cryptocurrency staked
    isActive*: bool   # Active status flag to indicate validator availability

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Type: Consensus
# - Stores the collection of validators participating in the blockchain consensus.
# - Reference object for shared, mutable state across node components.
# ------------------------------------------------------
type
  Consensus* = ref object
    validators*: seq[Validator]  # Active validator set

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Proc: initializeConsensus
# Purpose:
#   Initializes consensus state with a provided set of validators.
# Security Implications:
#   Validator sets must be securely managed and validated to prevent unauthorized validators from influencing network consensus.
#   The explicit initialization ensures a clear validator state, critical for security audits and maintaining transparency.
# ------------------------------------------------------
proc initializeConsensus*(validators: seq[Validator]): Consensus =
  Consensus(validators: validators)

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Proc: calculateQuorum
# Purpose:
#   Calculates the quorum necessary for Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-style consensus.
#   Ensures sufficient validator agreement to achieve consensus while tolerating faulty or malicious nodes.
# Cryptographic Security:
#   Quorum size explicitly set to a majority (greater than 50%) to mitigate attacks (e.g., Sybil, double-spending).
#   Aligns with established security practices to maintain integrity in a potentially adversarial environment.
# ------------------------------------------------------
proc calculateQuorum*(consensus: Consensus): int =
  consensus.validators.len div 2 + 1

# ======================================================
# Summary (Architectural & Cryptographic Insights):
# - Explicit definition of validators ensures clarity in stake and identity management, crucial for cryptographic security.
# - Validator activation toggling (`isActive`) explicitly addresses potential malicious validators.
# - Quorum calculation explicitly follows standard BFT best practices, preventing consensus attacks by requiring majority validation.
# - This design aligns security (economic incentives, Byzantine fault tolerance) with network architecture simplicity and maintainability.
