# Module: Virtual Machine (VM)
# Role: Transaction execution and gas metering
# Author's Perspective: System Architect & Lead Cryptographer
# ======================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Type: VM
# Purpose:
#   Manages smart contract execution through gas metering.
#
# Fields:
# - gasLimit: Represents the computational resources available for executing transactions.
# - Explicit gas management prevents denial-of-service attacks by ensuring resources are allocated fairly and securely.
# ------------------------------------------------------
type VM* = ref object
  gasLimit*: int  # Maximum allowed computation (gas) for transaction execution

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Proc: initializeVM
# Purpose:
#   Initializes the VM with a predefined gas limit.
# Security and Architecture Considerations:
#   Explicitly setting gas limits ensures predictable resource management, crucial for securing transactions and maintaining overall system stability.
# ------------------------------------------------------
proc initializeVM*(gasLimit: int): VM =
  VM(gasLimit: gasLimit)

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Proc: executeTransaction
# Purpose:
#   Executes a transaction if sufficient gas is available.
# Cryptographic and Security Implications:
#   - Explicit gas consumption checks protect against malicious transactions designed to exhaust computational resources.
#   - Ensures resource integrity, transaction validity, and economic fairness across the blockchain network.
# ------------------------------------------------------
proc executeTransaction*(vm: VM, txCost: int): bool =
  if vm.gasLimit >= txCost:
    vm.gasLimit -= txCost
    true
  else:
    false

# ======================================================
# Summary (Architectural & Cryptographic Insights):
# - Gas metering explicitly implemented to secure the blockchain network against resource-exhaustion attacks.
# - The architecture ensures transaction execution adheres strictly to resource constraints, maintaining network stability and fairness.
# - Clear and explicit gas management aligns with best practices for blockchain security and computational resource handling.
