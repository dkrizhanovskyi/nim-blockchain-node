# ======================================================
# Module: Signature Verification
# Role: Verification of digital signatures for transaction validation
# Author's Perspective: System Architect & Lead Cryptographer
# ======================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Procedure: verifySignature
# Purpose:
#   Verifies the authenticity of digital signatures by comparing provided signatures with expected signature formats.
#
# Parameters:
# - publicKey: The signer's public key, crucial for validating authenticity without exposing private keys.
# - message: The original message or transaction data to validate.
# - signature: The digital signature provided to verify authenticity.
#
# Security and Cryptographic Considerations:
# - Explicit validation ensures that signatures match expected cryptographic standards.
# - Placeholder implementation demonstrates logic clearly; actual implementation must employ robust cryptographic algorithms.
# - Ensures integrity, non-repudiation, and authenticity of blockchain transactions, crucial for system security.
# ------------------------------------------------------
proc verifySignature*(publicKey, message, signature: string): bool =
  signature == "signed_" & message

# ======================================================
# Summary (Architectural & Cryptographic Insights):
# - Clearly defined function provides foundational verification logic.
# - Placeholder explicitly indicates where cryptographic algorithms (e.g., Ed25519, ECDSA) should be integrated.
# - Essential for maintaining blockchain integrity by authenticating transactions securely.
# - Production implementation should integrate robust cryptographic validation methods.
