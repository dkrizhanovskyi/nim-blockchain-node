# Module: Zero-Knowledge Proofs
# Role: Generation and Verification of Zero-Knowledge Proofs
# Author's Perspective: System Architect & Lead Cryptographer
# ======================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Procedure: generateProof
# Purpose:
#   Generates a zero-knowledge proof for given data.
#
# Parameters:
# - data: Input data for which proof is generated.
#
# Security and Cryptographic Considerations:
# - Placeholder explicitly demonstrates intent; actual implementations must use established zero-knowledge algorithms like zk-SNARK or zk-STARK.
# - Crucial for privacy-preserving operations and secure authentication without exposing sensitive information.
# ------------------------------------------------------
proc generateProof*(data: string): string =
  "zk_proof_" & data

# ------------------------------------------------------
# Procedure: verifyProof
# Purpose:
#   Verifies the validity of a zero-knowledge proof against provided data.
#
# Parameters:
# - data: Original data associated with the proof.
# - proof: The zero-knowledge proof to validate.
#
# Security and Cryptographic Considerations:
# - Explicit verification of proofs ensures integrity and security of cryptographic operations.
# - Simplified placeholder indicates intended integration of secure, vetted cryptographic libraries.
# ------------------------------------------------------
proc verifyProof*(data, proof: string): bool =
  proof == "zk_proof_" & data

# ======================================================
# Summary (Architectural & Cryptographic Insights):
# - Zero-knowledge proofs explicitly support secure, privacy-preserving blockchain transactions.
# - Current implementation provides clarity and structure for future integration of robust cryptographic methods.
# - Ensuring proofs and verifications meet cryptographic standards is essential for overall system integrity and user privacy.
